						<h2>Becoming a Founding Member</h2>
						<p>Become a pioneering stakeholder, playing a key role in the initial distribution phase. A generous 40% of all tokens will be fairly and proportionally shared among early adopters. 
							There's no initial token price; fair access is at the heart of the distribution. This early access phase is already underway and set to wrap up in two months. 
							However, being open to welcoming more founding members the timeline might get extended! 
							Following this phase, another 30% of the tokens will fuel liquidity on Uniswap, and all contributions from the community will be funneled into the liquidity pool. 
							The total initial supply  of 365b is a symbol to the conviction that, with continuous effort and resilience, achieving your dreams is a 365-day journey!</p>

								<p>
									Transparency is a foundational value at GrindBunny. In the spirit of full disclosure, an audit has been conducted by ChatGPT 4.0. 
									While not a traditional audit firm, ChatGPT 4.0 offers an innovative approach that transcends the principal-agent problems often 
									encountered with conventional auditors. For those unfamiliar with the term, it refers to situations 
									where an auditor's interests may not align with those of the public. With the neutrality of ChatGPT 4.0, such concerns are mitigated. 
									Both the token code and the Fundraising Smart Contract code are accessible for scrutiny, and engaging ChatGPT 4.0 (or 3.5) for further inquiries is
									highly encouraged.

								and launched the social media channels. For Q3 2023, the focus is on
								finalizing the fundraising and launching on Uniswap. In Q4 2023, the reins will be handed over to the community because this token belongs to you!</p>

								<h2>Team</h2>

							<p>This is a community-driven initiative rooted deeply in the ethos of decentralization. There are no singular figures of authority like a CEO or a board of directors. We believe in the power of collective decision-making and the strength of community collaboration.

								Once the deployment of the token is complete, the steering wheel will not be in the hands of a select few but will be passed on to the community. The future direction, growth, and ethos of this endeavor will be guided by you. This token truly belongs to every participant, every supporter, every individual.
								
								We're building a movement, we are all the team.</p>

								<h2>FAQ</h2>
							</header>
							<details>
								<summary>What guarantees do I have that this token is legit?</summary>
								<p>It was ensured that this token is audited by ChatGPT 4.0, confirming its legitimacy. Please go ahead to verify this by checking out the audit yourself. Transparency is a core guiding principle.</p>
							</details>
							<details>
								<summary>What's the long-term vision for the token?</summary>
								<p>The long-term vision is to give power to the community, ensuring the token and its applications evolve to meet collective needs and desires. This token is not just for today, it's for a sustainable crypto future.</p>
							</details>
							<details>
								<summary>How can I become a founding member?</summary>
								<p>Scroll up to the "Become a Founding Member" section and follow the instructions.</p>
							</details>
							<details>
								<summary>Explain in more detail how the initial distribution will work?</summary>
								<p>Here's a straightforward example:
									imagine a hypothetical scenario where the total Ethereum pool amounts to 100
									ETH at the end of the contribution period. If Person A has contributed
									2 ETH to the pool, their contribution represents 2% of the total pool (2 out of 100). 
									Hence, Person A would be allocated 2%(2.92b) of the 40%(146b) GrindBunny tokens designated for 
									distribution. The more one contributes, the higher the allocation of tokens, adhering to
									the principle of a fair proportional distribution.</p>
